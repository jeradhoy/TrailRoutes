# Writeup

Writeup (Due Dec 9) You should submit a five page max writeup of your project. The writeup should clearly describe the problem you are working on, relevant background information, your solution, and any other interesting content that you would like to share with me about your project. Since each project may be very different in what it is doing, the writeups may be very different. We will discuss further details for the writeup during the proposal discussion.

Presentation (Due Dec 9) I want you have a project that you are proud of, so, the presentation is your time to shine. We will use the exam period for your presentations. Feel free to get creative. Like the writeup, your presentation will be vary depending on what you are working on. We will discuss further details for the presentation during the proposal discussion.
