# Trail Routing Algorithm


1. Can find loops from the same starting and ending point - why we can't use other shortest path (also doesn't take longer forks like second fork in new world gulch)
2. Set min and max trail distance.
3. Can repeat edges (probably only once)
4. BFS
5. Terminate search paths at maximum dist
